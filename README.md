# Embedded Systems - Lab3

This project was done in the scope of an embedded systems course, ECSE 421

The goal of this lab was to learn how to use interrupts, bit manipulation, and timers.
Finally, the level crossing from the previous lab is revisited, with the timers implemented using interrupts and timers instead of higher-level methods.
